# Cat Clicker

This app was an exercise in Javascript design patterns following [Udacity's Javascript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989). All of the code is vanilla js (no jquery) for version 1 and 2. For cat clicker premium I used jQuery.

A spec was given to implement. After implementing version 1, the spec was changed. After implementing the new spec, the spec was changed again. And again. The end goal is to show that by planning ahead using [separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) that adding functionality becomes easier and more maneagable to do.
